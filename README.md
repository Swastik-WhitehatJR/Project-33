# Project-33
This contains the files that were edited and coded in the Project 33 in WhitehatJR Pro Course. It has a snowfall animation with a cool UI. It is coded in javascript using "matter.js" and "p5.js" and styled in CSS using Neumorphism CSS and Glassmorphism CSS. To change the logic, edit the code in the file 'sketch.js' file.
